BOXZ is is an open source robot platform as do-it-yourself electronic pet! We connected Arduino, Plexiglass(PMMA), Origami and idea together, so we can easily and quickly build a remote pet by ourself! We can use it to playing football game, racing, fighting or some other interesting things!

Have fun!
